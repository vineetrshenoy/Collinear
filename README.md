# Collinear
Assignment in progress

Finding collinear points on a grid using sorting algorithms. This assignment was created for Coursera's "Algorithms I" hosted by Princeton University. The official assignment specification can be found here:http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/collinear.html

Using Comparators, points were sorted by slopes they make with an invoking point p, as well as their coordinates. This improved the speed at which collinear points (4 or more points on the same line) could be identified.

The APIs are as follows:



Brute.java is the Brute force algorithm to solve the problem, while Fast.java is the sorting-based algorithm to solve the problem.
